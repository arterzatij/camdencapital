Krambeer is featured in Registered Rep. Magazine in an article titled “The New Breakaways: Clients.” The article discusses the recent growth in Registered Investment Advisory firms, as investors have departed from the wire‐house brokerage model and have put their trust in independent advisory firms, such as Camden Capital.</p>\n\n<p style="text-align: justify;">During 2008 and 2009, Camden Capital added $300 million in new assets, bringing the company’s total assets under management to $550 million. This substantial increase in assets is due in large part to clients migrating away from brokers and turning to smaller firms like Camden. Full‐service brokers have collectively lost about eight percent of their client base since 2008 and have been projected to continue on that down trend, while smaller investment advisory businesses continue to rise little by little. However, due to their collective size and power, the larger wire‐houses do still dominate the investment industry… for now.</p>\n\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Mr. Krambeer explains that there are several reasons for the sudden rise in assets. A number of investors claim that larger corporations do not offer a satisfactory level of service. He states that one advantage of investing with an RIA, such as Camden Capital, is that each client’s individual needs are taken into account. Camden Capital recognizes each client’s risk characteristics and investment goals, in order to come up with a case‐specific, strategic investment plan.</p>\n\n<a class="btn" title="BACK TO RECOGNITION" href="http://192.168.1.86/camdencapital/recognition/">BACK TO RECOGNITION</a>";s:6:"filter";s:1:"1";s:4:"info";a:4:{s:4:"grid";s:1:"0";s:4:"cell";s:1:"0";s:2:"id";s:1:"0";s:5:"class";s:14:"WP_Widget_Text";}}i:1;a:4:{s:5:"title";s:0:"";s:4:"text";s:142:"<div class="post-sidebar">\n<br />\n<img class="photo" src="http://192.168.1.86/camdencapital/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/next-move.jpg"/>\n</div>";s:6:"filter";s:0:"";s:4:"info";a:4:{s:4:"grid";s:1:"0";s:4:"cell";s:1:"1";s:2:"id";s:1:"1";s:5:"class";s:14:"WP_Widget_Text";}}}s:5:"grids";a:1:{i:0;a:1:{s:5:"cells";s:1:"2";}}s:10:"grid_cells";a:2:{i:0;a:2:{s:6:"weight";s:17:"0.799752781211372";s:4:"grid";s:1:"0";}i:1;a:2:{s:6:"weight";s:19:"0.20024721878862795";s:4:"grid";s:1:"0";}}}'),

Utilizing a balanced approach, recommendations are constructed on a client-by-client basis while taking into account income needs and the needs of future generations. Our Monte Carlo simulation model is created to help determine how much or how little risk you need to take to generate the cash flow you desire to maintain your lifestyle, leave a legacy for your family, and/or meet your charitable intent.

Amist a rapidly changing tax and economic environment, we are committed to helping you create a comprehensive plan. We follow changes in the transfer tax laws, alert you of them, and develop timely planning strategies so you can take full advantage of any tax law changes that may help preserve your family’s wealth.</p>\n<p>Whether it’s setting up trusts for wealth transfer, identifying the intangible aspects worthy of consideration for the dispositive terms of your documents, working with you to extend your values in your legacy plan, or establishing a charitable giving approach, we apply sophisticated planning techniques to your investment strategy.

Utilizing a balanced approach, recommendations are constructed on a client-by-client basis while taking into account income needs and the needs of future generations. Our Monte Carlo simulation model is created to help determine how much or how little risk you need to take to generate the cash flow you desire to maintain your lifestyle, leave a legacy for your family, and/or meet your charitable intent. Your portfolio is then designed to increase expected returns while carefully monitoring risk to protect against downside movements in the markets.\n\nESTATE AND TAX PLANNING\nEstate taxes can destroy multi-generational wealth. While a basic estate plan allows you to decide who will receive your assets upon your death, advanced transfer tax planning may enable you to pass additional wealth to your descendants.\n\nWe work with your existing counsel, reducing your costs while accelerating the impact of the planning. Amist a rapidly changing tax and economic environment, we are committed to helping you create a comprehensive plan. We follow changes in the transfer tax laws, alert you of them, and develop timely planning strategies so you can take full advantage of any tax law changes that may help preserve your family’s wealth.\n\nWhether it’s setting up trusts for wealth transfer, identifying the intangible aspects worthy of consideration for the dispositive terms of your documents, working with you to extend your values in your legacy plan, or establishing a charitable giving approach, we apply sophisticated planning techniques to your investment strategy.

Through careful research and by drawing on past experience, we help you achieve your financial goals. We protect your investments, increase liquidity and diversify your portfolio, all with the goal of reducing investment risk while meeting your objectives.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align: justify;">ASSET ALLOCATION AND MONTE CARLO</h3>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Asset Allocation is a crucial step in developing a plan. Utilizing a balanced approach, recommendations are constructed on a client-by-client basis while taking into account income needs and the needs of future generations. Our Monte Carlo simulation model is created to help determine how much or how little risk you need to take to generate the cash flow you desire to maintain your lifestyle, leave a legacy for your family, and/or meet your charitable intent. Your portfolio is then designed to increase expected returns while carefully monitoring risk to protect against downside movements in the markets.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 style="text-align: justify;">ESTATE AND TAX PLANNING</h3>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">Estate taxes can destroy multi-generational wealth. While a basic estate plan allows you to decide who will receive your assets upon your death, advanced transfer tax planning may enable you to pass additional wealth to your descendants.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;">\r\nWe work with your existing counsel, reducing your costs while accelerating the impact of the planning. Amist a rapidly changing tax and economic environment, we are committed to helping you create a comprehensive plan. We follow changes in the transfer tax laws, alert you of them, and develop timely planning strategies so you can take full advantage of any tax law changes that may help preserve your family’s wealth.\r\n\r\nWhether it’s setting up trusts for wealth transfer, identifying the intangible aspects worthy of consideration for the dispositive terms of your documents, working with you to extend your values in your legacy plan, or establishing a charitable giving approach, we apply sophisticated planning techniques to your investment strategy.
